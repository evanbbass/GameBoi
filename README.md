# GameBoi
 GameBoi is a Game Boy emulator made as a personal project during the third semester of the programming track of at the University of Central Florida's (UCF) [Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA)](https://fiea.ucf.edu).
 
This is a work in progress. Below is a list of Developer Diaries for each week, a rough schedule that will be updated as I go along, and links to resources that I've been using.

Note that the Dev Diaries are not intended to explain the Game Boy hardware; links for that can be found in the referenes section. This is intended to describe my process for creating the emulator and any obstacles I ran into along the way.
